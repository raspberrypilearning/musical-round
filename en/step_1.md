## The tune
In the last project you used Sonic Pi to program music using letter names. This time we've provided the music for you.



+ Choose a buffer in Sonic Pi and Load `frerejacques.txt`. Check with your Club Leader if you don't know where the file is.

    Run it. Do you recognise the tune?

    <div id="audio-preview" class="pdf-hidden">
    <audio controls preload>
      <source src="sounds/frerejacques1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
    </div>


+ Let's give our tune a name so that we can play it when we want to.

+ Now nothing will happen if you run your code. You need to tell Sonic Pi to play 'fj'.

    Add the following line to end bottom of your code:

+ Try playing the tune with two different instruments:

The instruments play one after the other.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will program a musical round (Frere Jacques) to learn how to play sounds concurrently and program music using letter names. 

## Resources

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

##### Project Resources

+ frerejacques.txt

##### Club leader Resources

You can find a completed version of this project by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ frerejacquesround.txt
+ frerejacquesround.mp3

## Learning Objectives
+ Use threads to play multiple sounds concurrently.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "More instruments" - Add two more instruments to add more parts to the round. 
+ "More concurrency" - use the skills learned to program a new piece of music that uses concurrency.
