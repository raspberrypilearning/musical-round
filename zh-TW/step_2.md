## The tune

In the last project you used Sonic Pi to program music using letter names. This time we've provided the music for you.

+ Choose a buffer in Sonic Pi and Load `frerejacques.txt`. Check with your Club Leader if you don't know where the file is.

    Run it. Do you recognise the tune?
    
    <div id="audio-preview" class="pdf-hidden">
      <audio controls preload> <source src="resources/frerejacques1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. </audio>
    </div>
+ Let's give our tune a name so that we can play it when we want to.

+ Now nothing will happen if you run your code. You need to tell Sonic Pi to play 'fj'.
    
    Add the following line to end bottom of your code:

+ Try playing the tune with two different instruments:

The instruments play one after the other.
